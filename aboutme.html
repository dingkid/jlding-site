        <p> Hi! I'm Jessica "Jay" Ding. I'm a third-year (out of five) at Northeastern University majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Mathematics.
        I've lived in Mass for most of my life. Is that a good thing? I don't know, but I do love Boston as much as I hate it and am content with being here.
        <br>
        I like cooking, drinking tea, drawing, and playing rhythm games, but these days you're more likely to see me knitting. 
        My favorite food is noodles. My least is shellfish. 
        I enjoy spending free days <s>waiting for</s> riding the T, eating Chinese food and exploring the city.
        <br>
        I played the viola pretty seriously once but that was a hobby riddled with heartbreak and impostor syndrome. I still play, but not as much. Former BYS and BPYO member.
        <br><br>
        Blue is my favorite color.
        <br><br>
        All my socials that I feel like linking are under the "FIND ME" section on the side. Feel free to check them out.

    <h3>This Website:</h3>

      <p>
        This website started as a side project during my summer 2023 internship at New England Biolabs. Whenever I wasn't looking at spreadsheets, I would learn HTML and edit the site. 
        <br>

        <br>
        The concept of me having a website was pretty much ignored through the later half of 2023 and and mid-2024 when my domain expired and I never bothered to renew it. 
        If you can read this, that means I got the domain back.
        <br>
        Looking again at the website after seeing multiple examples of others' personal sites, I was pretty dissatisfied with how it looked. Since it had also been so long since I worked on the website,
        most of my work was imcomprehensible to me. I decided the best solution was to start from scratch with what I <i>did</i> know. So far, I already like it a lot better.
