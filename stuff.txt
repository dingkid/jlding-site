            <h3>MY BACKSTORY:</h3>
              <p>I was born at a very young age in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2004. At a slightly older age,
                I was flown to Shanxi, China and raised by my grandparents and was brought back at the age of 3. At some point, my family moved
                to Massachusetts, where I continued to be for the rest of my life up until now.</p>

              <p>My earliest memories began in Ipswich, Massachusetts. That was where I learned how to read (for the first time) and speak
                (for the second time). Most of my childhood was spent either at school, the piano bench, or by the ocean. Mostly the piano bench.
                My family moved once again in 2016 to Boxford, Massachusetts, where I graduated from Masconomet Regional High School in 2022.
              </p>

              <p>I am currently a Sophomore at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, expecting to graduate in 2027. These days I like to spend my freetime 
                seeing friends, walking around the city, drawing on my computer, clicking things on my computer, and listening to or playing music.
                I like rhythm games, the color blue, noodles, and tea. I hate shellfish. </p>

I was born in Pennsylvania, spent most of my infancy in Shanxi, China, and
                the rest of my life in Massachusetts.</p>

              <p>I graduated from Masconomet Regional High School in 2022. Currently, I am a Sophomore at Northeastern University 
                in Boston, Massachusetts studying Mechanical Engineering and expect to graduate in 2027.</p>

              <p>During my free time I like to make digital art and play the viola. I like rhythm games, travelling, the color blue,
                noodles, tea, and music. I hate shellfish.
